    "Fruitful functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fruitful function the return statement includes an expression, which means \"Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as a return statement executes, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach is called dead code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incremental developement: adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time to avoid long debugging sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the function syntax, then move onto basic assignment and computation, and then get more and more complicated until finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaffolding: code that is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product. Examples are print statements used to check incremental development of the program to make sure that each part is working properly before going to next part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key parts of Incremental Development:\n",
    "1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.\n",
    "2. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them\n",
    "3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some scaffolding or consoldiate statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition - the concept of calling one function from within another\n",
    "Ex. Calculating the area of a circle while calling a distance function to calculate the radius\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean functions - returning a boolean value.\n",
    "It is common to give boolean function names that sound like yes/no questions. Ex. is_divisible\n",
    "\n",
    "Often used in conditional statements, and can be used concisely without returning or comparing to a boolean:\n",
    "\n",
    "def is_divisible(x,y):\n",
    "    return x%y == 0\n",
