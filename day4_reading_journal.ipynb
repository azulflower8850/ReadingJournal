    "Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters, but in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest operator to create a list is with the [] operator. Lists can be nested and can be a combination of any type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list with no elements is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "LISTS ARE MUTABLE\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship bewteen indices and elements is called mapping, in which each index maps to one of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists indices work the same as string indices:\n",
    "1. Any integer expression can be used as an index\n",
    "2. If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError\n",
    "3. If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"in\" operator also works on lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing a list - the most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. for cheese in cheeses:\n",
    "    print cheese\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "    numbers[i] = numbers[i]*2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "A for loop over an empty list never executes the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations - the + operator concatenates lists, and the * operator repeats a list a given number of times. Slicing also works on lists:\n",
    "Ex. t[1:3], t[:4], t[3:], t[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "A operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "List methods - \n",
    "1. append - adds a new element to the end of a list\n",
    "2. extend - takes a list as an arguments and appends all of the elements.\n",
    "3. sort - arranges the elements of  the list from low to high\n",
    "\n",
    "list methods all void, will return none\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmented assignment statement - total += x is the same as total = total + x\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in function \"sum\" can add all the elements of a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce - an operation that combines a sequence of elements into a single value\n",
    "\n",
    "Map - an operation that maps a function onto each of the elements in a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter - an operation that selects some of the elements and filters out the others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting Elements:\n",
    "1. pop - t.pop() - modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. if not provided an index, it deletes and returns the last element.\n",
    "2. del - if you dont need the deleted value, use this. Ex. del t[1]\n",
    "3. remove - know the element to be removed, but not the index.\n",
    "4. more than one element at a time - del[a:b]\n",
    "\n",
    "list() - convert from a string to a list of characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Split() - break a string into words, Can use an argument that specifices which characters to use as word boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Join() - the opposite of split. Takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. A string method, must invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"is\" operator can be used to check whether two variables refer to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create two variables that both have the same string, python only creates one string object. But when you create two lists, you get two different objects. The two lists are equivalent, but not identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference - the association of a variable with an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alias - an object with more than one reference to it. If the object is mutable, then changes made with one alias affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "List as arguments - when a list is passed to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. if the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "THERE AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN OPERATORS THAT MODIFY LISTS AND OPERATORS THAT CREATE NEW LISTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. append modifies, the + operator creates a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. The slice operator creates a new list, but doesn't have any effect on the list that was passed as an argument. Rather, use a function that creates and returns a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging:\n",
    "1. Don't forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None.\n",
    "2. Pick an idiom and stick wtih it. Too many ways to do stuff, just pick one and use it\n",
    "3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n"
