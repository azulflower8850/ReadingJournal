    "Recursion is a function that calls itself.\n",

    "Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the function's local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The base case lies at the bottom of the stack, and prevents any more recursive calls.\n",

    "Evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical formulas. A recursive definition is similar to a circular definiton, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can write a recursive definition of something you can usually write a python program to evaluate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. For a factorial function, the method takes an integer. If the argument is 0, return 1. For the recursive call to work, we must find the factorial of n-1 and multiply it by n.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leap of faith - an alternative way to read programs besides the flow of execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you assume that the function works correctly and returns the right result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For recursion, when you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works and then ask youself \"Assuming that I can find the factorial of n-1, can I compute the factorial of n?\"\n",

    "Checking Types\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we give the factorial function 1.5 as an argument? Then it returns an error because it skips 0. To solve this, there are two choices:\n",
    "1. Generalize the function to work with floating point numbers\n",
    "2. Make the function check the type of its argument.\n",

    "First is called gamma function, too hard. Check types instead.\n",

    "Guardian - Conditions that come at the beginning of a function to protect the code that follows from values that might cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging. If a function is not working, there are three possibilities:\n",
    "1. There is something wrong with the arguments the functions is getting; a precondition s violated.\n",
    "2. There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated\n",
    "3. There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rule out first possibility, add a print statement at the beginning of the function and display the values of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then add a print statement before each return statement that displays the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function with values that make it easy to check the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value is being used correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of execution more visible."
