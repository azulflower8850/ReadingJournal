    "  2. Looking at the leading terms of the two polynomials, one is n^2 and the other is n. Multiplying this yields n^3, which would be the order of growth of the overall function since it's going to be the leading term. So the order of growth is O(n^3)\n",
    "  3. The order of growth of af+b is still O(g), as coefficients and constants can change the runtime for small data sets, but in the long run it will remain the same g growth, so the order remains the same.\n",
    "  4. The order will still be O(g), because just simply adding them doesn't change the order of growth. Their coefficients might change, but the leading term will still be the same power, so nothing really changes.\n",
    "  5. It's hard to tell, because we don't know which one is a higher growth order. Since we're just adding the two together, the leading term will be the same order of growth, so in this instance the order of growth will be either O(g) or O(h), depending on which one is bigger\n",
    "  6. In this case we are multiplying, so that changes things. The multiplication will likely change the leading term by changing the power or something, so the order of growth is probably something like O(g*h). It's hard to pinpoint exactly because there are edge cases and the functions are arbitrary which elevates the ambiguity, but in general when multiplying two functions together, it should result in the multiplcation of their order of growths."
