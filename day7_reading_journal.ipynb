    "Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is like a list, but more general. The indices in a dictionary can be almost any type, unlike a list which requires integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary can be thought of as a mapping between a set of indices (called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a kay-value pair or sometimes an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. eng2sp = dict()\n",
    "eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "eng2sp['two'] = 'dos'\n",
    "eng2sp['three'] = 'tres'\n",
    "print eng2sp\n",
    "{'one':'uno','three':'tres','two':'dos'}\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable. But that doesn't matter because elements of a dictionary are found using the keys to look up the corresponding values.\n",
    "\n",
    "print eng2sp['two'] \n",
    "'dos'\n",
    "\n",
    "The key 'two' always maps to 'dos', so the order of the items doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key isn't in the dictionary, you get an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The len function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as a key in the dicionary (not the value)\n",
    "\n",
    "The .values() method can be used to see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The in operator is different in dictionaries than for lists. Lists use a search algorithm, whereas dictionaries utilize a hashtable that  takes the same amont of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways to do this:\n",
    "1. Create 2 variables, then travserse the string and increment each variables per letter.\n",
    "2. Create a list of 26 variables, convert each character to a number, use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.\n",
    "3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. Then increment existing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation is a way of performing a computation; some are better than others. For dictionaries, an advantage is that  we don't know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a for statement on a dictionary traverses the keys of the dictionary. Remember that the keys are in no particular order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lookup - given dictionary and key, find the corresponding value\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Lookup - given value, find key, requires searching algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise - causes an exception. takes an argument for messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse lookup much slower than forward lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. Ex. given a dictionary that maps letters to frequencies, but now invert it so that the dictionary maps frequencies to letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be values, but not keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys must be hashable. A hash is any function that takes a value and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these to store and lok up items.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works fine only if the keys are immutable; that's why lists are bad as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memos - a previously computed value that is stored for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary that stores computed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables - variables that are declared outside functions and are part of the global \"__main__\" frame. Can be accessed by any function and persists through all function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables can't be changed with a variable within functions because those functions are local.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reassign, you must declare the global variable before you use it in a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add, remove, and replace elements of mutable global variables, but if you want to reassign it, you must declare it.\n",
    "\n",
    "global variable name\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers with an L in the back are long integers, they can be arbitrarily long, but they consume more time and space as they get bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking data by hand. here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n",
    "1. Scale down the input\n",
    "2. Check summaries and types.\n",
    "3. Write self checks\n",
