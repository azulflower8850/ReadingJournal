    " - class - a user defined type of data structure that can contain attributes and methods.\n",
    " - object - an instance of a class, kind of like a creation of the class, a manifestation of it\n",
    " - instance - a manifestation of a class, generally referring to objects of a class\n",
    " - attribute - a variable within a class that can be called using the dot notation\n",
    " - method - a function within a class that can be invoked using the dot notation\n",
    " - shallow vs deep copying - shallow copying only copies an object at the surface, any embedded remain pointing at the same reference. Deep copying is complete copying of an object and all references to embedded objects.\n",
    " - pure functions vs modifiers - pure functions are functions that return something, used in functional programming and need not modify any of the objects passed to it. modifiers are functions that directly modify the object that they are passed.\n",
    " - initializing object instances - use the class name with parentheses to initiate an object. If you want to be fancy you can use the __init__ function which allows you to directly initialize any attributes that are in the class.\n",
