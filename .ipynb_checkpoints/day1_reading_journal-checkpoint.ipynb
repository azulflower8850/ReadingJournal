    "Hi everyone.  These are the exercises for the first set of readings from ThinkPython.  While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

Additionally, in order to write text in this document, you will be making use of markdown cells.

    "Python is a high-level language, such as C, C++, Perl, and Java. They have to be processed before they can run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Low-level languages are referred to as machine languages or assemble languages. Computers run low-level languages directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of High-Level: Easier to program, less time to write, easier to read. Portable-run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level is not portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of program process high-level:\n",
    "1. Interpreters- reads high-level and executes it; processes it a little at a time, alternatively reading and computing.\n",
    "2. Compiler- reads high-level program and translates it before running it. Source code is translated to object code or excecutable. Once compiled, can execute repeatedly without re-translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python- interpreted language. Twos ways:\n",
    "1. Interactive mode - type python, interpreters displays result. Good for a few lines of code.\n",
    "2. Script mode - store code in a file and interpreter executes content of file. Better for big programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Program - sequence of instructions that specific how to perform a computation. Can be mathematical, searching, replacing\n",
    "\n",
    "Key instructions in every language:\n",
    "1. input: get data\n",
    "2. otput: display data\n",
    "3. math: compute stuff\n",
    "4. conditonal execution: check conditions\n",
    "5. repetition: perform repeats\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs -  programming errors\n",
    "Debugging - tracking them down\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of errors\n",
    "1. Syntax errors -  structure error or rule error of program. There can't be a single syntax for python to run\n",
    "2. Runtime errors - error doesn't appear until after program starts running. Also called exceptions.\n",
    "3. Semantic error - Will run fine, but not do the right thing you wanted. Must work backwards, most tricky to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural languages - languages people speak, not deisgned by people\n",
    "Formal languages - languages designed by people for specific application. Programming languages are formal, designed to express computations. Strict syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax rules, two flavors:\n",
    "1. Tokens - basic elements of a languages, like words, numbers.\n",
    "2. Structure - the way the tokens are arranged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing - figuring out what the structure of the sentence is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Formal and Natural: \n",
    "1. Ambiguity - natural languages full of it, formal languages meant to be completely unambiguous.\n",
    "2. Redundancy - natural has a lot, formal less so and more concise\n",
    "3. literalness - natural full of idioms and metaphors, formal mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs - meaning of a program is unambiguous, and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
